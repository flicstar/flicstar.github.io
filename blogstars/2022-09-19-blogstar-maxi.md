Maxi shows us how to establish context. The principles used here quickly identify the article as part of a series - helping orient the reader and manage their expectations.

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that establish context and help identify this article as part of a series. 

- **LEDE, FRONT** - The `tl;dr` at the top of the article clearly identifies the point of the content.
- **SUBHD** - Great use of headings to structure the piece. Consistent with other posts in this series.
- **CLUTT** - Supporting information is linked out from the article to keep the text focussed. The reader can choose to follow or stay on the page.

üéâ Kudos to Maxi for some great writing!
