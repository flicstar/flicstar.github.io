Justin overcomes the curse of knowledge and writes simply to explain well. The writing principles shown here create a digestible technical-explainer.

> G'day! flicstar your friendly editor here. I help writers create great written content. Let me help you improve your writing by taking a look at what some others are doing really well.

Today I looked at some writing by [Justin](https://technically.dev/justin) of [Technically.dev](https://technically.dev): 

üìù [APIs for the rest of us](https://technically.dev/posts/apis-for-the-rest-of-us/)

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it work really well. 

- **SIMPL** - Low Flesch-Kincaid score for technical subject matter.
- **ILLUS** - Diagrams help understanding.
- **TOOM, TRUST** - The piece is scoped, and admitting the extent of your knowledge works to establish trust with the reader.


üéâ Kudos to Justin for consistently great writing!
