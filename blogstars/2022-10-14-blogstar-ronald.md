In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it work:

- **SBHEAD **- Use headings as a structural aid to chunk your content.
- **HEAD**- Choose words that define the purpose of each text block. Try to use consistent construction.
- **ACTIV, LEAD** - Lead with actions and use the active voice to make your content engaging.


üéâ Kudos to Ronald for some great writing!
