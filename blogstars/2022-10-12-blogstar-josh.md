Today I looked at some writing by [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/):

üìù [A World-Class Code Playground with Sandpack](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/next-level-playground/)

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it delightful:

- **TONE **- The audience is clearly articulated, and the choice of language and tone is pitched at the right level. The article respects the audience by assuming a level of knowledge.
- **DIR** - The author uses a combination of text and visuals to take you on a learning journey. The writing is linear in a satisfying way - it doesn‚Äôt leave any gaps.
- **ILLUS, EXMPL** - Great use of graphics and examples to help build understanding.
- **JUDG, FUD** - The article presents drawbacks and challenges, but always in a respectful way (not casting fear, uncertainty or doubt). This allows the author to present a comprehensive picture. Talking about the good side and bad side of a thing is best, and being able to talk about the downside without being negative is a skill we should all strive for.


üéâ Kudos to Josh for some great writing!
