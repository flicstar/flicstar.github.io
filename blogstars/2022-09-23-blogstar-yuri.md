Yuri swears 🙊 and that's okay. 👍 The writing principles on display here are some of the most fundamental — connecting with your readers through word choice to demonstrate empathy and build trust.

Today I looked at some writing by [Yuri Lee](https://yurilee.hashnode.dev/), who writes on Hashnode.

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that show why profanity can sometimes work. 

- **CNECT** - The content includes swear words which resonate with the target audience and show the writer’s authenticity.
- **EMPATH** - Swear words convey frustration with humor to connect with the readers.

The swears in Yuri’s writing tap into the struggle of learning something new - conveying frustration in a really satisfying way. This establishes trust. Moving beyond empathizing and connecting with readers, the author pays off by delivering solutions. 

🎉 Kudos to Yuri for some great writing!
