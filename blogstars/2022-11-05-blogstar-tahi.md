Tahi shows us how to write authentically. Authentic voice is something to be prized - especially amidst the rise of AI content generators. The writing principles used here work together to make the article compelling and engaging.

Today I looked at some writing by [Tahi](https://muntahatahiat.hashnode.dev/), who writes on Hashnode.

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it authentic:

- **DIRCT **- The article is written in first person and directly addresses the reader. 
- **FEEL** - The author shares their own voice through the writing to paint pictures and create feelings - this helps build trust with the reader.
- **COLOR** - Personality infuses the writing, and the conversational tone is consistent throughout.

🎉 Kudos to Tahi for some great writing!
