Tymoteusz shows us how to keep things digestible. The writing principles used here work together to make the article really consumable and scannable.

Today I looked at some writing by [Tymoteusz Motylewski](https://typeshare.co/tmotyl), who writes on typeshare.

In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it work:

- **WIIFM **- The title clearly identifies why the reader should keep reading.
- **FLOW** - The text is nicely structured to keep the eye moving down the page.
- **LIST** - The text is organized with ordered and unordered lists to avoid a **WALL** of text.

üéâ Kudos to Tymoteusz for some great writing!
