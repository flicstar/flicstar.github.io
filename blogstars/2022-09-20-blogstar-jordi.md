Today I looked at some writing by [Jordi Boggiano](https://seld.be/): 

üìù [Narrowing types for static analysis](https://seld.be/notes/narrowing-types-for-static-analysis/)


%[https://youtu.be/t8SeQ19IBCk]


In my [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) on this article, I highlight a couple of principles that make it work really well. 

- **ANLGY** - The use of a simile early on paints a word picture, adding life to the content.
- **FLOW, RHYTH** - Paragraph structure creates an engaging rhythm and encourages the reader to keep reading.
- **SPOCK** - Stepping stones of logic help to gradually reveal ideas and take the reader on a journey of understanding.

üéâ Kudos to Jordi for some great writing!
