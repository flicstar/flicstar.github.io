## Editing

I spend most of my time doing developmental and substantive editing but I don't have a lot of examples that are free to share. 

| Type   |      Example      |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Copy editing | * [TYPO3 v11.4 Into New Galaxies](https://typo3.org/article/typo3-version-114-into-new-galaxies)<br />* [Documentation Team Sweeping Week](https://typo3.org/article/documentation-team-sweeping-week)|
| Proof reading | * [New Code of Conduct - Give your feedback](https://typo3.org/article/new-code-of-conduct-give-your-feedback) <br />* [Server Team Status Report October 2021](https://typo3.org/article/server-team-status-report-october-2021) |
