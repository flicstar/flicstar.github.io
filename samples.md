* [DITA Mini Manual](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual) - An open-source project I wrote hosted on Github.
* [Analysis strategies](https://help-in.qsrinternational.com/1-help/Content/analyze/analysis-strategies.htm) - I'm particularly proud of this Help page because, through many iterations with SMEs, I reduced a lengthy explanation into a very concise article about how to use the software.
* [Understanding sociograms](https://youtu.be/wwyXC6lDK98) - A video tutorial. I did the storyboard, wrote the script and used Camtasia to create the video.
* [Interpris tutorial](https://help-in.qsrinternational.com/1/slideshow/slideshow/Default.htm) - This was fun! I co-wrote this in-app tutorial with my colleague. We user-tested this thoroughly to validate the user experience and terminology.
* [About Maps](http://help-nv11.qsrinternational.com/desktop/concepts/About_maps.htm) - I'm particularly proud of this Help page because I explain why and when to use a feature rather than just how.
* [Unattended command line installation](http://techcenter.qsrinternational.com/desktop/nv11/nv11_unattended_command_line_installation.htm) - This is a technical Help page I wrote for administrators to roll out a desktop product.
