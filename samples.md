## Editing

I spend most of my time doing developmental and substantive editing but I don't have a lot of examples that are free to share. 

I have been editing for the [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/) blog since early 2021. Here are just two examples (scroll down to the bottom to see my contribution credit):

* [TYPO3 v11.4 Into New Galaxies](https://typo3.org/article/typo3-version-114-into-new-galaxies)
* [Documentation Team Sweeping Week](https://typo3.org/article/documentation-team-sweeping-week)

| NVivo - Qualitative analysis desktop software | * [Analysis strategies](https://help-in.qsrinternational.com/1-help/Content/analyze/analysis-strategies.htm) - I'm particularly proud of this Help page because, through many iterations with SMEs, I reduced a lengthy explanation into a very concise article about how to use the software. <br />* [Understanding sociograms](https://youtu.be/wwyXC6lDK98) - A video tutorial. I did the storyboard, wrote the script and used Camtasia to create the video.<br /> [Interpris tutorial](https://help-in.qsrinternational.com/1/slideshow/slideshow/Default.htm) - This was fun!

We user-tested this thoroughly to validate the user experience and terminology.<br />* [About Maps](http://help-nv11.qsrinternational.com/desktop/concepts/About_maps.htm) - I'm particularly proud of this Help page because I explain why and when to use a feature rather than just how. <br />* [Unattended command line installation](http://techcenter.qsrinternational.com/desktop/nv11/nv11_unattended_command_line_installation.htm) - This is a technical Help page I wrote for administrators to roll out a desktop product. |
