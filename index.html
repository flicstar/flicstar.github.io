<p>I am a technical communicator working in (mostly) open source. I enjoy helping writers and non-writers create great written content! I work remote and asynchronous, and I'm based in Melbourne, Australia.

<h2>Day Job</h2>

<p>I work as a technical editor and writer at <a href="https://openstrategypartners.com/" target="_blank">Open Strategy Partners</a>, a strategic communications agency.
I love being a part of this team, where I can <a href="https://openstrategypartners.com/blog" target="_blank">write</a> and 
 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3JRgwdSRC8knAdkMrU6jOb" target="_blank">speak</a> about writing and editing.
</p>

<h2>Open source</h2>

 <p>I am a member of the <a href="https://typo3.org/" target="_blank">TYPO3 Association</a>, an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the <a href="https://typo3.org/community/teams/content" target="_blank">Content Team</a>. 
  This is a great community. If you're looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it!</p>

 <p>I helped found <a href="https://thegooddocsproject.dev/" target="_blank">The Good Docs Project</a> in 2019, creating best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software. It's heaps cool over 
  there - you should totally check it out.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
I helped update <a href="https://boffin.education/category/books/technical-writing-books/" target="_blank">The Technical Writing Process</a> book to the 2nd edition. My main contribution was about reviewing drafts, editing and giving feedback. check out <a href="https://boffin.education/review-draft/" target="_blank">chapter 22</a>!
