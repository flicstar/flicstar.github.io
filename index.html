<p>I work as a technical editor and writer at <a href="https://openstrategypartners.com/" target="_blank">Open Strategy Partners</a>, a strategic communications agency. I love being a part of this team, where I can <a href="https://openstrategypartners.com/blog" target="_blank">write</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3JRgwdSRC8knAdkMrU6jOb" target="_blank">speak</a> about writing and editing.</p>

<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://typo3.org/" target="_blank">TYPO3 Association</a>, an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the <a href="https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation" target="_blank">Documentation Team</a> and <a href="https://typo3.org/community/teams/content" target="_blank">Content Team</a>. This is a great community. If youâ€™re looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it! I co-authored <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246" target="_blank">The TYPO3 Guidebook</a>, published January 2021.</p>
