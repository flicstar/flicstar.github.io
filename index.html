 <p>I am a member of the [TYPO3 Association](https://typo3.org/){:target="_blank"}, an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the [Content Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/content){:target="_blank"}. 
  This is a great community. If you're looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it! I co-authored [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246){:target="_blank"}, published January 2021.</p>
