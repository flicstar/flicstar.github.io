<!--more-->This little knitted monster is made from my hand-dyed, hand spun yarn. It is the Maddox pattern from <a href="www.rebeccadanger.typepad.com" target="_blank">Rebecca Danger</a>.

The pattern gave me the opportunity to learn a few new techniques like knit front and back (KFB), 3 needle bind off and knitting in the round using the 'magic loop' method.
