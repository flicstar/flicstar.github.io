I was inspired to make this SunMoon felted piece by a remarkable drawing from my young niece.

In crayon, this picture sings with movement and life. It is so animated! and happy! I love it.

I love how the moon is in profile while the sun is facing forward. Seeing these pictures now I realise I forgot the eyebrows. Or maybe that was a design decision? I can't remember.

To make this piece in felt, I started with a white background then laid out my blue and red fleece around a circular placeholder to get the shape.

I used more fleece, prefelt and cheesecloth scraps to complete the basic design.

Then I wet it all down with my trusty bulb sprayer and felted it.

Next it dried on the clothes line and then a quick needle felt to 'round out' the moon which had become misshapen during the felting process.

I then did some machine embroidery to outline the shapes and add some detail.

Then I hand stitched black accents and outlines.

I completed it with a black frame and I'm pleased with the result. Although it is quite a different piece to the original inspiration, I enjoyed the challenge of making it and am very thankful to my niece for such a beautiful design.
