I presented at the [Everything Open 2023](https://2023.everythingopen.au/) conference in Melbourne. My talk was called [Boost your project's trust signals with great docs!](https://2023.everythingopen.au/schedule/presentation/30/)

I work at Open Strategy Partners, where [trust plays a big part in how we communicate](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/communicate-connect-grow-the-osp-origin-story/). 

After my talk, the questions and discussion that arose from the audience showed that there was a big interest in docs and tech writing, and their associated challenges like: 

- too many docs 
- not enough docs 
- where to publish the docs
- working with tech contributors 
- the loneliness of lone writers. 


Overall, it was a friendly, welcoming, professional event, with a wonderful organizing committee and supportive tech staff. The live streaming went off without a hitch! Really cool.
