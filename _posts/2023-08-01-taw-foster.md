# Foster Writers Program Season 3

I'm a member of the Foster Writers Collective and this year, I took part in [Season 3](https://www.foster.co/season3), one of their five-week writing programs. It was called "The Artisan's Way". 

> The age of average writing is over. The future belongs to artisans. As the media world gets noisier and more mediocre,
> the writers who will win—both economically and culturally—will increasingly be the true artisans. At Foster, we believe that focusing on substance,
> craft, and voice is the only way to matter in the future.

This was the first writers program I've ever been involved with - and I loved every second. I fully committed.
