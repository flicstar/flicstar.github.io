Let's face it: **[DITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) is hard work**. There is a steep learning curve and once you get it, you feel like you deserve an "I've climbed Everest" t-shirt.![drivermanual](/assets/images/drivermanual.jpg?w=96)

A little while ago, I developed an open-source sample [DITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) project. It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual) and is based on a 1960's [Morris Mini Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini) Owner's manual.

It will suit anyone wanting to explore a real DITA documentation project or anyone with an interest in Minis!

#### What is it?

It's a complete DITA project, made up of a series of topics and ditamaps which together illustrate the use of many DITA features such as metadata, cross-references, indexes and reuse (through conref and conkeyref).

The project also demonstrates conditional publishing for Morris Mini Saloon and Traveller models, as well as the Austin Countryman (a re-badged Morris Traveller).

#### What does that mean?

I've done the hard work for you! If you are learning DITA and want to see how things are supposed to hang together, take a look at this project and experiment with different output formats and conditions.

You can play around with it and then generate the Mini Owner's Manual as a PDF, an HTML Help file or whatever you fancy.

#### What tools do I need?

I wrote this using [Oxygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) authoring software (with guidance and QA review from [Tony Self](https://twitter.com/hyperwrite)).  You don’t need to use Oxygen XML to edit the content because DITA is a standard - so any DITA tool is suitable.

#### OK, where can I get it?

The project is available for anyone to download from [https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual).

#### Where can I learn more?
