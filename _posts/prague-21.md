At Write the Docs Prague 2021, I was happy to share the story of writing The TYPO3 Guidebook with a community of my fellow documentarians.

> **Write the Docs**
> The conference focused on all things related to software documentation.

## About TYPO3 and the reason for the book

TYPO3 is an enterprise, open source CMS. The TYPO3 community is a mature, thriving community with active and engaged members. Their motto: **"Inspiring people to share"**.
TYPO3 enjoys popularity in many parts of Europe, but were looking to increase international adoption, welcome newcomers to the userbase and grow the community.  
A whole lot of devs who are busy coding are too busy to even squeeze out a blog post, let alone a book - so this is something that our agency (Open Strategy Partners) could help them with, especially when writing isn’t their day job. 

## Nerding out about processes 

As a technical writer who had never written a book before, this was a lot like writing a _very big_ concept topic, spending lots of time talking to subject matter experts to elicit their knowledge.

Open Strategy Partners brought structure and rigor to the process. We had an internal project manager who liaised with our publisher, Apress, and kept everyone on target.

The framework of the book is 4 overview chapters followed by 10 practical guides. 

We used raw data taken from interviews with experts from the community. We worked in Google Docs, which is a great tool for sharing and reviewing. In many cases we could easily share content for review and 
some folks just directly wrote whole swathes of content when they felt something hadn't been covered. 

Once handed over to our publisher, they engaged technical reviewers from the community. At this time we engaged the Design Team to create graphics and diagrams for us. Community members also
added fully tested code to our GitHub repo to support the guides in Part 2 of the book.

This is a great story about developer relations. We were able to capture the expertise of the designers, engineers, and experts in the TYPO3 community and weave their story into a cohesive whole. 

## How does writing a book fit into DevRel? ##

Sam Juleen, DevRel at Auth0 - (he writes the Developer Microskills newsletter - and if you don’t already follow it, you should because I highly recommend it.)
He talks about the whole full range of skills of the developer advocate falls into two broad categories of **speaking** and **listening**. 

We did the listening part first:
We were already members of this community and we just fully immersed ourselves. We attended loads of events and did a lot of interviews face to face and written interviews. Speaking with highly technical, highly passionate developers about the CMS, what they liked about it, how they used it - all the different use cases -, and the very specific areas that they worked on.

The speaking part comes with the creation of the book itself. We took the expertise and knowledge from the community and stitched it into a cohesive whole so that the book can do the speaking, covering key points DevRel points of _awareness_ and _education_. 

## The value of a book for a community

Of course docs and blog posts are going to have the most up-to-date information, and are easy to search for. 

But books aint dead. And print books still outsell ebooks. So while books aren’t as important as they used to be, they do still have a place in this multi-channel world of technical content. 

The book doesn’t speak to one audience. It meets the needs of different types of readers and that’s the power of writing a book, rather than having a collection of blog posts or pages in the docs, it gives you that opportunity to carefully curate your content with a clear goal in mind.

Books serve **beginners** well because they are foundational and they’re linear. If you’ve got a real newbie, they can just start at the beginning and read. They’ll get the overview, they can work through the tutorials sequentially.

The book is also helping **experienced developers** who are approaching this new technology for the first time. It’s helping them understand the basic principles right away. The system architecture, development approach and coding standards and guidelines. 

It’s helping **decision makers**, anyone evaluating the CMS. Perhaps they’re going to be maintaining this thing so they want to find out about the release cycle, how to upgrade, and performance. Security. They can just jump straight to chapter 4 and do that. They may not work through the practical component of the book like a newbie might, but they would probably eyeball those to get a feel for how the CMS works.

> They don’t have to navigate docs, they don’t have to dive into detail. 

## Try it yourself ##

My hope with this story is to inspire other communities, other organizations to consider writing a book. 
Because you’re tapping into the expert knowledge of your devs and channeling that into a useable, tangible asset that becomes a resource to help other devs learn and to help tell the story of your product. 
And share the value of what they’re working on. 
You can add to your stable of content. One that can sit comfortably alongside the other resources you already have for your product. 

## Buy it, Share it, Review it

You can buy the book at all good bookstores (for example, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484265246/)), and in the [TYPO3 Shop](https://shop.typo3.com/).

Talk about the book on Twitter with the hashtag #TYPO3Guidebook
