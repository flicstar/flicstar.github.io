Ever had to write a fortune?

I’m working on a crochet project - a bowl of fortune cookies.

The pattern I'm following stitches them closed and embroiders a smiley face on the outside but I chose to include actual fortunes inside my cookies.

Writing challenge! I knew I wouldn't have a lot of space or flexibility for presentation of the messages, so brevity was key. I also had to make some style decisions.

> Font. Punctuation. Language.

Next, because I was using iron-on transfer paper I needed to print the text backwards. I created mirror text in Word and did a few test prints.

\[gallery type="rectangular" ids="54,55"\]

**Result**

You can't turn tech writing off, no matter the project.
