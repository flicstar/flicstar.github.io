I'm proud of everything I achieved during such a challenging year.

### Speaking and improving my speaking skills

- at conferences and events
- on podcasts (interviewed and interviewee)
- did research (books and podcasts, almost coaching)
- got streamcam, standing desk.

### TYPO3

*   Did a fair bit of spruiking for [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://shop.typo3.com/TYPO3-Guidebook/TY10049)
*   Contributed to the TYPO3 [Official Documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/)
*   Initiated the Microcopy special interest group (with workshops from Roger Sheen), which was later enfolded into the UX Inititative.
*   As part of OSP:
    * Worked in the Content Team to contribute to articles published on [typo3.org](https://typo3.org/).
    * Helped create the TYPO3 Writer's Guide.

### The Good Docs project

*   Resigned from the Steering Committee.
*   Hung out on the periphery, popping up on Slack and helping out with the [Chronologue Working Group](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/chronologue/)

I hope to be able to devote more time to this project next year.

### Events

*   Presented at TYPO3 Online Days
*   Contributed to Author Q&A on Twitter
*   Presented at Write the Docs Prague
*   Presented at DevRelCon[Write the Docs meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Write-the-Docs-Australia/events/268284615/)
*   Attended [Write the Docs Australia & India super meetup](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2020/)

### Firsts

This year I conquered a few things I had never done before. 

* Migrated my blog from WordPress to GitHub Pages. This was both a painful and satisfying process. 
* Social listening and making connections. This is the human side to consuming content online, and being involved in different communities. I felt happy and privileged to be able to connect people and tasks across communities, and share celebrations of success. 
* Twitter and social posting. Suffice it to say, I'm not a natural at this. Tweeting on behalf of Open Strategy Partners, as well as writing Facebook and Linked In posts was a  task added to my weekly list. I subscribed to many and various newsletters to find fodder for this task.
* Evaluated conference proposals for the Write the Docs Australia & India conference. This was an enjoyable process, not diminished by the fact that the conference was cancelled and replaced by a 'super meet-up'. I hope to be able to do this again.
