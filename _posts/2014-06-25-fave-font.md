Some time ago I applied for a tech writing job and part of the application process required me to fill out some questions online. They were standard scenario questions like "_Describe a time you had to handle multiple conflicting priorities_" but one of the questions was “_What’s your favourite font?_”

This kind of tickled me. Was it a trick question? Separation of form and content is (for some people) an integral part of being a technical writer. We’re not graphic designers, but I believe you do need to have an appreciation for design and how your output is presented to your readers - because this impacts the way it is consumed. Font plays a role here.

Anyway, in my response I decided to cover both bases - saying that tech writers shouldn’t have a favourite, but since you ask... THEN I had to think about some fonts.

#### Know any good fonts?

As it happened, we had recently given a facelift to the release notes where I was working. We had to scout around for a clean, professional, modern-looking font. Management had told us they really liked the [Microsoft Windows 8 release notes](https://www.microsoft.com/about/mspreview/windows8/windows8_rp_product_guide.pdf), so we went with [Segoe UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe). For a while, that was my favourite font.

But I also have a preference for [Proxima Nova](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova), which is used on the [ABC news website](http://www.abc.net.au/news/) and is actually one of the [most popular fonts](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year) on the web. (I use the [Chrome extension WhatFont?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) to identify fonts on websites.) So without too much thought, I did actually have two fonts I could talk about to give a credible response in this job application.

#### Be prepared

The fact that this company included such a question in the recruitment process demonstrated their expectations about what they wanted a tech writer to do. They’re expecting a design element to your skill set. It pays to be prepared. Have a few fonts up your sleeve ready to pull out for just such an occasion.
