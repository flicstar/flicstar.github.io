My first appearance in a podcast â€“ [Application](https://typo3.org/article/meet-felicity-brand-typo3-guidebook-author-australia-application-podcast-s1e4) the TYPO3 Community Podcast, season 1 episode 4.

This podcast was [launched in 2020](https://typo3.org/article/meet-application-the-typo3-community-podcast) with the aim to celebrate the community members of the TYPO3 CMS project.

I spent last year co-authoring a [guidebook about TYPO3](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246), to promote adoption of the open-source, enterprise content management system.

The experience of being interviewed for a podcast was nerve-wracking and you can hear it in the stilted way I speak. I was desperate to form clear and meaningful sentences because I was â€˜on the recordâ€™. I thought I would be more relaxed!

I am very appreciative of the great post-production and editing work that was put in to make me look and sound decent.
