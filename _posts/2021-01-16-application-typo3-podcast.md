This year I made my first appearance in a podcast â€“ [Application, the TYPO3 Community Podcast](https://typo3.org/article/meet-felicity-brand-typo3-guidebook-author-australia-application-podcast-s1e4), season 1 episode 4.

This podcast was [launched in 2020](https://typo3.org/article/meet-application-the-typo3-community-podcast) with the aim to celebrate the community members of the TYPO3 CMS project. 

We spent the episode talking about the book I co-authored for the community, [the TYPO3 Guidebook](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246), which we wrote to promote adoption of the open-source, enterprise content management system.

The experience of being interviewed for a podcast was nerve-wracking and you can hear it in the stilted way I speak. I was desperate to form clear and meaningful sentences because I was â€˜on the recordâ€™. I thought I would be more relaxed!

I am very appreciative of the great post-production and editing work that was put in to make me look and sound decent.
