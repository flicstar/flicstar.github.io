Another challenging year! Yet I still managed to achieve more than I thought I would.


### Speaking and improving my speaking skills

* Spoke at several [conferences and events](#Events) this year, which was great practice. 
* Spoke on the Open Strategy Partners podcast: [Communicate, Connect, Grow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK1FgQnuVwknf_CWenjZSMw). My favourite episode so far is [PAX](https://openstrategypartners.com/pax-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-06).
* Interviewed my colleagues for an episode about Developer Relations, which has not yet aired.
* Actively researched speaking techniques and vocal skills to improve how I come across on video and audio. Most notably [Emmanuella Grace](https://findyourvoiceaustralia.com/) and [Chrstine Canters](https://thecmethod.com/). I read heaps of books, online articles and listened to loads of podcasts.

### TYPO3

*   Did a fair bit of spruiking for [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://shop.typo3.com/TYPO3-Guidebook/TY10049).
*   Contributed to the TYPO3 [Official Documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/), including writing docs for the [Admin Panel](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-adminpanel/main/en-us/Index.html).
*   Initiated the [Microcopy and UI Text](https://talk.typo3.org/t/microcopy-and-ui-text/3809) special interest group (with workshops from Roger Sheen), which was later enfolded into the UX Inititative.
*   As part of [OSP](https://openstrategypartners.com/):
    * Worked in the Content Team to contribute to articles published on [typo3.org](https://typo3.org/).
    * Helped create the [TYPO3 Community Language & Writing Guide](https://guides.openstrategypartners.com/typo3-guide/).

### The Good Docs project

*   Resigned from the Steering Committee.
*   Hung out on the periphery, popping up on Slack and helping out with the [Chronologue Working Group](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/chronologue/)

I hope to be able to devote more time to this project next year.

### <a name="Events"></a>Events

*   Presented at Day 3 of [TYPO3 Online Days 2021](https://t3onlinedays.typo3.com/events-program). "The TYPO3 Guidebook - a community-sourced writing project" [Watch it](https://youtu.be/b4P0D3cQi3s?t=6630) ðŸŽ¥
*   Contributed to an [Author Q&A](https://twitter.com/typo3/status/1407248240156815360) on Twitter.
*   Presented at [Write the Docs Prague 2021](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2021/). "How to write a book for (and with) an open source community" [Watch it](https://youtu.be/Enq7Esg3tHY) ðŸŽ¥
*   Presented at [DevRelCon](https://2021.devrel.net/). "Channeling a community to write a book" [Watch it](https://youtu.be/F1LpTXBgego) ðŸŽ¥
*   Attended [Write the Docs Australia & India super meetup](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/news/cancel-announcement/).

### Firsts

This year I conquered a few things I had never done before: 

* **Migrated my blog from WordPress to GitHub Pages**. This was both a painful and satisfying process. 
* **Social listening and making connections**. This is the human side to consuming content online, and being involved in different communities. I felt happy and privileged to be able to connect people and tasks across communities, and share celebrations of success. 
* **Twitter and social posting**. Suffice it to say, I'm not a natural at this. Tweeting on behalf of Open Strategy Partners, as well as writing Facebook and Linked In posts was a  task added to my weekly list. I subscribed to many and various [newsletters](https://flicstar.com/newsletters-i-follow) to find fodder for this task.
* **Evaluated conference proposals** for the Write the Docs Australia & India conference. This was an enjoyable process, not diminished by the fact that the conference was [cancelled](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/) and replaced by a 'super meetup'. I hope to be able to do this again.
