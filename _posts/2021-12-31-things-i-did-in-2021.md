Another challenging year during which I achieved more than I thought I would.

### TYPO3

*   Did a fair bit of spruiking for [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://shop.typo3.com/TYPO3-Guidebook/TY10049).
*   Contributed to the TYPO3 [Official Documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/) as part of the [Documentation Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation), including writing docs for the [Admin Panel](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-adminpanel/main/en-us/Index.html).
*   Initiated the [Microcopy and UI Text](https://talk.typo3.org/t/microcopy-and-ui-text/3809) special interest group (with workshops from Roger Sheen of [Infotexture](https://infotexture.net/)), which was later enfolded into the UX Inititative.
*   As part of [OSP](https://openstrategypartners.com/):
    * Worked in the Content Team to contribute to articles published on [typo3.org](https://typo3.org/).
    * Helped create the [TYPO3 Community Language & Writing Guide](https://guides.openstrategypartners.com/typo3-guide/).

### The Good Docs project

*   Resigned from the Steering Committee.
*   Hung out on the periphery, popping up on Slack and helping out with the [Chronologue Working Group](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/chronologue/).

I hope to be able to devote more time to this project next year.

### <a name="Events"></a>Events

*   [TYPO3 Online Days 2021](https://t3onlinedays.typo3.com/events-program) presented *[The TYPO3 Guidebook - a community-sourced writing project](https://youtu.be/b4P0D3cQi3s?t=6630)* ðŸ“¢
*   Contributed to an [Author Q&A](https://twitter.com/typo3/status/1407248240156815360) on Twitter.
*   [Write the Docs Prague 2021](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2021/) presented *[How to write a book for (and with) an open source community](https://youtu.be/Enq7Esg3tHY)* ðŸ“¢
*   [DevRelCon](https://2021.devrel.net/) presented *[Channeling a community to write a book](https://youtu.be/F1LpTXBgego)* ðŸ“¢
*   Attended [Write the Docs Australia & India](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/news/cancel-announcement/) super meetup.

### Speaking and improving my speaking skills

* Spoke regularly on the Open Strategy Partners podcast: [Communicate, Connect, Grow](https://openstrategypartners.com/how-we-write-and-edit-at-osp-podcast-s1e1). My favourite episode so far is [PAX](https://openstrategypartners.com/pax-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-06). 
    * [Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3JRgwdSRC8knAdkMrU6jOb?si=21e9cdfcf33a4501) (or wherever you like to listen to podcasts ðŸ˜„)
    * [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK1FgQnuVwknf_CWenjZSMw)
* Spoke at several [conferences and events](#Events) this year, which was great practice. 
* Spoke on the [Developer Advocate Stories](https://www.europeclouds.com/blog/chapter-34-developer-advocate-stories-with-felicity-brand) podcast. An abysmal failure, and a salutary lesson to speak from the heart â™¥ rather than trying to memorise my speaking points. When I inevitably forgot them (two seconds in!!), I went into freefall and [no words came at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1b6TeCvBng).  
* Interviewed my colleagues for a podcast episode about Developer Relations, which has not yet aired.
* Actively researched speaking techniques and vocal skills to improve how I come across on video and audio. Most notably [Emmanuella Grace](https://findyourvoiceaustralia.com/) and [Chrstine Canters](https://thecmethod.com/). I read heaps of books, online articles and listened to loads of podcasts.
 
### Firsts

This year I conquered a few things I had never done before: 

* **Migrated my blog from WordPress to GitHub Pages**. This was both a painful and satisfying process. 
* **Social listening and making connections**. This is the human side to consuming content online, and being involved in different communities. I felt happy and privileged to be able to connect people and tasks across communities, and share celebrations of success. 
* **Twitter and social posting**. Suffice it to say, I'm not a natural at this. Tweeting on behalf of [Open Strategy Partners](https://twitter.com/open_strategy), as well as writing Facebook and Linked In posts was a  task added to my weekly list. I subscribed to many and various [newsletters](https://flicstar.com/newsletters-i-follow) to find fodder for this task.
* **Evaluated conference proposals** for the Write the Docs Australia & India conference. This was an enjoyable process, not diminished by the fact that the conference was [cancelled](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/) and replaced by a 'super meetup'. I hope to be able to do this again.
