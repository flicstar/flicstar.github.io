Make up your own mind.

Want to find out more about web3? Yeah, me too. 

Web3 is a polarizing issue. It’s difficult to find balanced views on the topic, which means you have to traverse the two extremes to form your own view.

Here is a collection of Web3 resources to help you understand more about this technology movement. Take your own tour to see what destination you arrive at. 
I summarize my position at the end.

Start with this episode of the Web3 Breadowns podcast about the 
[Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/97809264/millegan-ethereum-name-service?tab=shownotes). Similar to the concept of DNS, which anyone who's every had to buy a domain should be able to relate to.

Next go to the Chris Dixon episode of the same podcast: The Potential of Blockchain Technology [https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/22848496/dixon-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology?tab=shownotes](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/22848496/dixon-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology?tab=shownotes) 

At the end of the episode, Chris sums up Web3: \
“It's about power and money on the internet. Who has that? How has it governed? How is it controlled? How does the money flow? What's the economic model? Those are really important questions. This is why crypto and blockchains matter.”

Note that Chris Dixon is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), an influential company investing in crypto and blockchain.

Now that you’re primed, the next thing to do is read Moxie Marlinspike’s article. Moxie is the founder of Signal and he’s a respected person in tech - his article raised some criticisms about the web3 space so it caused quite a splash when it came out in January 2022. 

My first impressions of web3 [https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) 

Next you can read the responses to Moxie:



* Vitalik Buterin’s response (co-founder of Ethereum). “Moxie's critiques in the second half of the post strike me as having a correct criticism of the current state of the ecosystem, but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going.” https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/my_first_impressions_of_web3/hrrz15r/
* Suzuha’s On Web3 Infrastructure. [https://mirror.xyz/suzuha.eth/vb5E5lhzmPTcpxOJcz6Q211TDgSvoFwDLA6JSM1V37Q](https://mirror.xyz/suzuha.eth/vb5E5lhzmPTcpxOJcz6Q211TDgSvoFwDLA6JSM1V37Q) 
* Mikeal’s In response to moxie’s awesome nft. (from Protocal Labs) https://mikeal.notion.site/in-response-to-moxie-s-awesome-nft-d4880b55c61e42e3bfd9525a8a78d8ef

Next it’s story time. Back to Web3 Breakdowns podcast for the fascinating tale of when a DAO tried to bid for the United States Constitution. “The Week Crypto Bid for The Constitution”. [https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/45635106/piedrafita-the-week-crypto-bid-for-the-constitution?tab=shownotes](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/45635106/piedrafita-the-week-crypto-bid-for-the-constitution?tab=shownotes) 

Now that you’ve heard that, let’s head to YouTube for ‘Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs’ by Dan Olson. This is 2 hours of your life, but you can watch it on 1.5x playback speed. The video has chapters so you can jump around. Pay attention to his perspective on the Constitution DAO, as well as his points about IP and copyright.

Following on from that nicely is “[Can the law keep up with crypto?](https://www.theverge.com/22944579/crypto-bitcoin-internet-law-nft-tiktok-dances-tonya-evans-interview)” with [Professor Tonya Evans](https://proftonyaevans.com/) on the Decoder podcast. She covers copyright law and how to enforce smart contracts in DAOs in real life. 

Molly White’s website: Web is going just great [https://web3isgoinggreat.com/](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/). Check out an interview with her here: How a Wikipedia editor became one of the loudest Web3 skeptics [https://www.fastcompany.com/90733574/how-a-wikipedia-engineer-became-one-of-the-loudest-web3-skeptics](https://www.fastcompany.com/90733574/how-a-wikipedia-engineer-became-one-of-the-loudest-web3-skeptics) 

Prepare for the delicious ear onslaught that is Balaji Srinivasan. He is a general partner as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). He spoke on The Knowledge Project podcast episode 134 The Network State. This is an epic episode, almost 3 hours. I listened on 1.5x playback speed. It’s totally worth your time—Balaji is a deep thinker and compelling speaker.

[https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast-transcripts/balaji-srinivasan-134/](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast-transcripts/balaji-srinivasan-134/) , 

Next check out one of the most watched TED talks of all time by Don Tapscott (founder of the Blockchain Research Institute) from back in 2016. How the blockchain is changing money and business [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl8OlkkwRpc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl8OlkkwRpc) 

That’s it. We’ve arrived. Where did you land? 

## My views 

I think the internet my 4 year old daughter interacts with soon is going to be very different from the internet I’m using today. 
I think blockchain technology is going to play a big part in that - and I would argue it’s already happening. That’s a lot of toothpaste to stuff back into the tube.

* Web3 and decentralization is going to combine with the ideas of metaverse and social economics (1000 true fans [https://medium.com/@jeroenrs/one-thousand-true-fans-all-you-need-to-know-about-marketing-in-a-single-article-fdc3c4cef186](https://medium.com/@jeroenrs/one-thousand-true-fans-all-you-need-to-know-about-marketing-in-a-single-article-fdc3c4cef186)) and deep fakes (what is reality?).
* The speculative hype over NFTs and cryptocurrency has muddied the water around blockchain technology. 
* The environmental impact needs to be addressed
* Web3 is not truly accessible to all since you need money to pay for hardware and electricity to currently participate.

What are your thoughts?
