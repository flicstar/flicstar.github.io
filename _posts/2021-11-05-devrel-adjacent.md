As a technical writer, I can relate to DevRel.

When writing for end-users of software, as a tech writer, you’re a user advocate. When your readers are developers, doesn't it naturally then 
follow that you are a developer advocate? 

Being a tech writer in software means I’ve always worked alongside developers. Sometimes in a team of writers seated next to the dev team; 
other times as a lone writer embedded with devs in a cross-functional team. 

Over the years I have developed an affinity for software engineers. I have an understanding of the challenges they face, what frustrates them 
and what motivates them. (Of course, I'm generalizing!) Without developers, I wouldn’t have had a job - there’s 
no tech writing without something technical to describe. I’m good at writing and communication, so it makes sense that I use my powers for good. I look at how I can use my skills to remove barriers for devs and empower them to do their job. That comes in the form of communication, editing and writing good docs. 

Typically I spend some time in our client communities, checking Slack and looking at what’s topical, what’s going on. Events coming up, security updates, new releases, a new thing that a special interest group has built. And I look for opportunities for making connections between teams and how we can help people succeed. (That bring sme to back to: removing barriers and empowering developers). 
Naturally I’m involved in creating a lot of content. So that can be anywhere from writing articles, tutorials and guides, product updates through to social messaging. 
I also do a lot of technical editing - making sure that content that my colleagues have written or content that dev writers from our clients have written is the best it can be and to make sure it’s fitting into the strategy that we’ve agreed.

If speaking and listening are the fundamentals of DevRel, then you’re listening when you elicit info from your subject matter experts (SMEs)—who happen to be developers. And you’re speaking when you create accurate and compelling content for developers to consume. 

Granted, not every tech writer is involved in community building (but they might be if they work closely with Support teams who maintain a 
forum or user-group around the product) or presenting deep-dives into code or practical, how-to sessions at conferences. 
But most tech writers are deeply aware of their audience and readership, and understand their challenges, and want to remove barriers by 
creating great content - be that UI copy or UX writing, procedural and official docs, blog posts, etc.

So as a technical communicator, then, I am DevRel adjacent. This explains why I feel like so much of the DevRel content out there is speaking 
directly to me, even though I am not a developer.
