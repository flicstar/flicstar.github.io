As a technical writer, I can related to DevRel.

When writing for end-users of software, as a tech writer, you’re a user advocate. When your readers are developers, does it then follow that you are by nature a developer advocate? 

Being a tech writer in software means I’ve always worked alongside developers. Sometimes in a writing team seated next to the dev team; sometimes as a lone writer embedded with devs in a cross-functional team. 

I think most tech writers have an affinity for software engineers. Over the years I have developed an understanding of challenges they face, seen what frustrates them and also seen some of what motivates them. I’m good at writing and communication, so it makes sense that I use my powers for good. Without developers, I wouldn’t have had a job - there’s no tech writing without something technical to describe. So I look at how to empower them and remove barriers. And that empowerment comes from communication, content, and writing good docs. 

Typically I spend some time in our client communities, checking Slack and looking at what’s topical, what’s going on. Events coming up, security updates, new releases, a new thing that a special interest group has built. And I look for opportunities for making connections between teams and how we can help people succeed. Remove barriers, empower developers. 
Naturally I’m involved in creating a lot of content. So that can be anywhere from writing blog posts and articles, support material like tutorials and guides, and social messaging. 
Personally, I do a lot of technical editing - making sure that content that my colleagues have written or content that dev writers from our clients have written is the best it can be and to make sure it’s fitting into the strategy that we’ve agreed.

If speaking and listening are the fundamentals of DevRel, then you’re listening when you elicit info from your SMEs who happen to be developers. And you’re speaking when you create accurate and compelling content for developers to consume. 

Granted, not every tech writer is involved in community building (but they might be if they work closely with Support teams who maintain a forum or user-group around the product) or presenting deep-dives into code or practical, how-to sessions at conferences. But most tech writers are deeply aware of their audience and readership, and understand their challenges, and want to remove barriers by creating great content - be that UI copy or UX writing, procedural and official docs, blog posts, etc.

So as a technical communicator, then, I am DevRel adjacent. This explains why I feel like so much of the DevRel content out there is speaking directly to me, even though I am not a developer.
