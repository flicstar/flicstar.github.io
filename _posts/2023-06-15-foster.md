This year I joined [Foster](https://www.foster.co/) as a contributor. Foster is a writers collective who are assembled around a
[GDocs Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foster-%E2%80%93-your-friendly-hu/naofaoalandhmapmbecoaajgmkkdeedg) that allows 
authors access to real-life editors and collaborators. Writers get timely feedback from experts. Contributors (like me) get the joy of editing, and 
working with other editors and writers to help make a piece of writing the best it can be.

I‚Äôve always loved [collaborative writing](https://flicstar.com/collaboration-in-tech-writing), and editing is my all-time favorite activity! Foster 
has given me the opportunity to stretch my muscles to work on different types of writing outside my daily [bread-and-butter](https://openstrategypartners.com/about-us/). Since 
January, I‚Äôve edited a mix of fiction and non-fiction including personal essays, LinkedIn posts, Twitter short stories, a white paper, and even poetry! Topics 
have ranged from business to personal and I‚Äôve been privileged to read authors' thoughts on a variety of topics such as personal growth, travel, medical marijuana, 
reflections on grief, NFTs, classical music and taking sabbaticals. 

I've loved the variety and challenge so far, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next.
