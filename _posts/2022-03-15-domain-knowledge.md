What does it mean to understand complex technical topics at a high level? 

I have a broad and shallow understanding of technology. I knew this was a good thing but I couldn't articulate it until I came across a 
requirement for a tech editing role: “**_We'd like someone who can understand complex technical topics at a high level_**.” (Thanks [Draft.dev](https://github.com/draftdev/jobs/blob/main/editor.md) for this description.) 

The [February 2022 edition](https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/newsletter-february-2022/) of the Write the Docs newsletter came to the conclusion that while “domain knowledge trumps all”, you need “just enough” 
knowledge to get your work done. I think this holds true for editing as well as writing. As a technical editor, you _do_ need domain knowledge. You need to understand the subject matter to be 
able to add value. But you don't always need a deep knowledge—and sometimes, to really add value, you need an awareness of how that subject matter fits within a broader domain.


### Editing excellence through domain awareness

Mark Baker talks about a state beyond domain knowledge in a post from 2016, 
[Writing Excellence Through Domain Awareness](http://everypageispageone.com/2016/04/29/writing-excellence-through-domain-awareness/).

Domain awareness is about recognizing "which concepts, ideas, and principles belong uniquely to that domain" and further, what sits around it—knowing it's place in 
the universe. Being able to understand the space outside a domain gives you the ability to add value, especially in writing about technology. The landscape is vast!

Domain awareness means I can advocate for the reader and polish writing to be clear and simple - especially around a complex topic.

How does a tech writer upskill in tech? By getting their hands dirty. I recently came across a Google job description outlining different ways a candidate may have gained domain knowledge:  

> "Experience in technologies (software or hardware systems) by investigation, direct experimentation (for example, 
> reading or running code), and interactions with Subject Matter Experts."—Google

How did I come to a place of domain awareness? All of the above, plus _time_. I think it’s a combination of working and lived experience (14 years’ a tech writer), and a steady diet of 
consuming industry content (I read a lot!). This has enabled me to edit content about a variety of topics these past couple of months sweeping across:  

* Core mergers and certification for an open source CMS.
* Blockchain, miners, validators, staking and pooling for a web3 client.
* Async PHP, non-blocking and event-driven architecture for a digital agency.
* User research and testing, website IA, A11y and human-centered design for a UX group.
* Devops, automated testing and shifting-left for the internal IT team of a major corporation.


### How domain awareness makes me a good editor

Writing about tech can get really noun-heavy. For writing to be clear, it’s important to identify actors in a sentence, and what is being acted upon. My understanding 
of tech stacks, processes and workflows means I can better identify the subject of a sentence, and parse the verbs, nouns, and adjectives. This helps me separate 
clauses if needed, or change passive constructions. I may not understand the nuts and bolts of the technology or language, but I know enough to flag
awkward or unclear phrasing, and when to ask for clarification from the writer.
