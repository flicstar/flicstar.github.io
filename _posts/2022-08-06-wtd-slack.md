With over 220 channels and more than 15,000 people, the Write the Docs Slack can get noisy. Here is how I use Slack to navigate one of the best free tech 
writing resources around!

## The nuts and bolts 

The Write the Docs Slack network is free to join, and is a wonderful space for connecting with like-minded people. 

Write the Docs have a comprehensive [explainer page](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) about their use of Slack. It includes the 
[signup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq4DWRphVt1qVqH8NsjNnS0Szu_NljjZRUvyYqR7mdc00zKQ/viewform), the social guidelines,
a channel guide, and stacks of other great info. Check it out! 

Slack is a tool, and people use it differently. There is no right or wrong way to do it—make it work for you.


## Check out the channels

You’re in. It’s noisy. Take a moment to browse the channels. Join a bunch, then mute a bunch. 

Here's my recommended approach: 

1. **Geography** - Join the channel for your geographic region(s).
2. **Products and processes**:  
    * Join product-related channels for any tools you’re using, like `flare` or `confluence` or just plain `doctools`. 
    * Join process or methodology-related channels that jibe with your current workflow, like `agile`, `docs-as-code`, `knowledge-management`. 
3. **Special interest** - Join channels that are of professional interest, like `lone-writer`, `managing-writers`, `style-guides`, `learn-tech-writing`. Don’t forget `job-posts-only` if you’re looking for work.
4. **Human connection** - Participate in non-work-related channels like `watercooler`, `flame-thrower`!, `makers`, `pets`, `music`.


## Lurking is not a dirty word

Actually “lurker” _is_ a dirty word and [we shouldn’t use it](https://guild.co/blog/why-ban-term-lurker-in-community/). But the behavior itself 
is fine. A [lurker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker) (otherwise known as “community member” 😁 or “vicarious learner”) tends to read rather 
than talk. The point is that it’s OKAY to read and never talk. The community is very welcoming and supportive, so it’s fine to use the Slack community 
to just hang out, read, and learn. When you’re ready to ask a question, the hive mind is ready (and friendly)! 

> We have great moderators, but remember to abide by the [social guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/#guidelines).

## Use keywords

Here’s a cool thing: you can specify keywords and get notified when they’re used—even in muted channels. For example, I’m interested in web3 
and blockchain, and I have those set in **Preferences** > **Notifications** > **My keywords**. Whenever someone uses one of these keywords, I get a 
little badge icon and it’s highlighted in the chat.
