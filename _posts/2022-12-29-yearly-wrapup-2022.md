This year I encountered the phrase “[career dysmorphia](https://leadersayswhat.com/2015/10/when-is-impostor-syndrome-actually-career-dysmorphia/)”. I think 
I have this! Ever since going freelance, I struggle to value my own achievements and see how much I’ve grown. I find that writing these yearly wrap-ups help 
me to see that I’ve worked HARD all year.

# Writing & Editing

## Editing

I leaned into editing this year. Here’s what I did:

* Joined the [Institute of Professional Editors](https://www.iped-editors.org/) (IPEd)
* Tested myself with the IPEd sample exams (I may sit the accreditation exam next time around).
* Took the Udemy course, [Editing Mastery: How To Edit Writing To Perfection](https://www.udemy.com/course/editing-mastery/) by Shani Raja.
* Read and listened to as many editing resources as I could.
* Started writing about editing on Hashnode, [flicstar edits](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/).
* Broadened my editor network on LinkedIn. I reached out to folks, created connections, responded to posts and was generally more present and active there.
* Engaged more on Twitter with the hashtash #amediting.
* Created the [#tech-editing](https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C03P7JWSYSV) channel on Write the Docs.

## Writing 

I wrote a lot more this year. 

* Wrote more posts on my own site about tech writing and web3.
* Got published in [code:words](https://medium.com/words-in-tech/tech-writing-listens-to-add-to-your-feed-33577026c1f9) on Medium. 
* Got [featured](https://twitter.com/hashnode/status/1558219283783720960) by Hashnode.
* Joined the effort to co-write (with an impressive bunch of tech writers) the 2nd edition of the popular book, [Technical Writing Process](https://technicalwritingprocess.com/), by Kieran Morgan.

## Videos

I made some recordings to become more comfortable speaking in front of the camera. I’m still trying to find my authentic voice. I know it’s in there somewhere!

I consume a lot of content, and often find connections between different things. I made one video about that - on the topic of tech 
writing [portfolios](https://flicstar.com/flicstar-chats-portfolios). The first of many such videos?

I wanted to record real-time reviews of other peoples’ writing. I ended up concentrating on just a few key writing principles per post, and 
these turned into ‘positivity passes’. I created a series called [blogstars](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/series/blogstar), over on Hashnode.

# Events

* Evaluated submissions for the Write the Docs Australia conference. I also volunteered on the [conference committee](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2022/team/) - managing the [Writing Day](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2022/writing-day/) 
* activities. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to help out again next year.
* Got accepted to speak at the next [IPEd conference](https://www.iped-editors.org/iped-conferences/).
* Discovered the [Everything Open](https://2023.everythingopen.au/) conference happening in Melbourne next year.
* Created (with help from my colleagues at OSP) a handy one-pager for podcasts and events.

# Open Strategy Partners

I spent another year working with [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/). I continued to learn about communication strategy, 
said hello and goodbye to some great colleagues, and enjoyed working in the space of authentic comms.
