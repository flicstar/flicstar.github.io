This year I encountered the phrase “[career dysmorphia](https://leadersayswhat.com/2015/10/when-is-impostor-syndrome-actually-career-dysmorphia/)”. I think 
I have this! Ever since going freelance, I have struggled to value my own achievements and see how much I’ve grown. I find that writing these yearly wrap-ups help 
me to see that I’ve worked HARD all year.
