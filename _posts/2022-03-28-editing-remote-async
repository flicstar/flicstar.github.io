For me, the catalyst to morph from tech writer to tech editor was asynchronicity.

Working asynchronous, remote (who isn’t, these days?), and part-time gives me little opportunity to get into [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Or, put another way, it means I have to be laser-focused when I sit down to the keyboard.

Short bursts of productivity means I’m using my time effectively. Once I’m familiar with the client and their communication strategy, I can 
get straight down to a substantive edit, developmental edit or just a final polish and proofread. It means our clients always get quality. It 
means my colleagues don’t lose momentum when they’re working on a piece. And we can deliver content sooner.

The tyranny of asynchronicity turned me into a great editor. I got really good at:

* Async collaboration - a boon for editors and their authors.
* Creating connections in a remote (and distributed) team.
* Writer empathy and compassion


### Async collaboration

I don’t have the luxury of talking to my author in real-time. All of my editing suggestions and comments are framed from the point of view of 
being an asynchronous conversation with the author. 

Editing is a conversation, and you need to ask questions. But when you’re asynchronous, you don’t have time to wait for the answer. So best
practice is to use context to make educated guesses about author intention. Make the most efficient use of my time and their time to get the most 
information, the best outcome with the least back-and-forth.


### Creating connections

It’s not essential, but it’s helpful to have a relationship with your writers. That means, making an effort to establish human connection. I 
like to use any tool I can to be friendly, show my personality and establish rapport with my writers. A lot has been written about working remote 
and async. GitLab is famously all-remote and they have some useful information in their [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

### Writer empathy

Editing lends itself to moments of rapid focus and there isn’t a lot of blank-page-creativity required. So sometimes I find it really hard to tackle 
the writing tasks that do inevitably come my way. 

Hard as it is, it’s important that I continue to write because that’s what helps me be a good editor. I’m reminded just how difficult writing can be, 
to enter a state of flow and create. Being aware of this discomfort helps me be a compassionate editor—I know what
that writer has gone through to create a piece before it gets to me. Of course I’m going to be empathetic to their struggle and acknowledge their effort.


## Friendly elf

I do sometimes feel like a friendly elf, and I have been dubbed [Heinzelmännchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinzelm%C3%A4nnchen), since the agency I
work for, [OSP](https://openstrategypartners.com/), is based in Cologne where that story originates. 

> It’s a cautionary tale: keep your Heinzelmännchen happy, or you will work alone.—[The Elves of Cologne](https://germangirlinamerica.com/heinzelmannchen-the-elves-of-cologne/)

To be an effective friendly elf, you need a great async production process, so that everyone is set up for success. That means task management tools
(we use [Asana](https://asana.com/)), established hand-off behaviors, and great communication skills.


## Editing gives me the warm and fuzzies ♥

My favorite thing is knowing that I’ve made someone else’s job or day easier. Handling editing tasks for my writer colleagues is the most valuable use 
of my asynchronous time. While they’re asleep, I can turn around their writing-task with a good edit. They can wake up ready to move to the next stage of 
the editorial process. 

To top it off, editing tasks are discrete, with a clear start and finish. So I get the satisfaction of feeling like I’ve completed something at the end of the day.
