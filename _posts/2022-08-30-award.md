I’m very pleased and proud to receive a [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/growing/peer-bonus) award. Yay!

Googler, [Cameron Shorter](http://cameronshorter.blogspot.com/), nominated me for my contributions to [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/). Thank you Cameron!


## The Good Docs Project

I was nominated for my contributions to [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), where we are creating technical writing templates to help other projects create high-quality documentation. I’m passionate about the work we’re doing there, and have been hanging around the project since its inception in 2019. 

This is a friendly, inclusive community creating a safe space for folk to dip their toe into open source. We are global, and new folk are [always welcome](https://forms.gle/N2jFaRfg21t3TyJZ6) - please come and join in the fun!


## What I love about open source

I love working in open source. It suits me down to the ground: I’m intrinsically motivated, I work well asynchronously, and I am passionate about building things! 

Open source lets you work closely with experts who you might not normally get access to in a more traditional or siloed company. You know that people are turning up because they want to be there. And there is a shared understanding that people give what they can. 


## Other open source adventures

My first experience with open source was a [DITA project](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual) I wrote back in 2014. Five years later I participated in the inaugural [Google Season of Docs](https://flicstar.com/season-of-docs-retro) in 2019, during which I worked with [OSGeo Live](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/osgeolive/) and first met Cameron. 

When I’m not busy with The Good Docs Project, I help out in the Docs Team and Content Team for [TYPO3 CMS](https://typo3.org/), a mature open source project with a thriving community and ecosystem. 

In my day job, I get to work with open source clients every day with [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/), a strategic tech-communications agency. We help open source projects (and technology companies) communicate the value of their products.


## Thanks Google!

Thanks again Google, and Cameron, for this token of appreciation. I am grateful to receive it and will continue contributing for as long as I can. 

It’s great that Google does their bit to support open work, helping non-Googlers to build and add to public tools and knowledge.
