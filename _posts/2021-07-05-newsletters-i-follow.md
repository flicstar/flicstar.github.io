I subscribe to a lot of newsletters. I like best the ones that are weekly or better yet, monthly. I like to receive then read pretty much straight away.
I tried that other tool, but it requires me to go in and read, which doesn't work for me. 
This way, it's curated, its in context and I can follow up and read in the moment or in the next few days. File it away. I can see how big it is and how much time to devote.


## Currently reading

### Work 
These newsletters cover a range of things I'm interested for my professional work like writing, UX, DevRel and tech.

* [Write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/)
* [DevRelWeekly](https://devrelweekly.com/ )
* [Developer Microskills](https://developermicroskills.com/) from Sam Julien. Not just for developers! My current favourite newsletter!
* [The 3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1) from James Clear.

* [Increment](https://store.increment.com/products/increment-subscription). A quarterly, full-color magazine that is excellent.
* [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). "A front-end web development newsletter that sparks joy". It's excellent!
* [Velocity](https://velocitypartners.com/blog/). B2B content marketing. I still haven't decided if I'm going to continue reading this one.
* [FeverBee](https://www.feverbee.com/richs-blog/). Richard posts too frequently - sometimes daily! No matter the quality of the content, I'm going to unsubscribe.

* [Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter/) from Kottke.org


## Retired from my list
I subscribed to these newsletters for a long time but have since moved on because I find that I no longer need  what they have to give. I still like to dip in when I have time or need to look up something in particular.

* [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)
* [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/)
* [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
