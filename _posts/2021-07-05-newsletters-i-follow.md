A list of newsletters that I subscribe to for work and play.

I subscribe to a lot of newsletters. The ones I like best come weekly (or better yet, monthly!) and straight to my inbox. I tried [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) but it didn't suit the way I like to consume information. 

I think the best newsletters contain practical and useful content. 

## Currently reading

### Work 
These newsletters cover a range of things I'm interested in, like writing, UX, DevRel and tech.

* [Write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/)
* [DevRelWeekly](https://devrelweekly.com/ )
* [Developer Microskills](https://developermicroskills.com/) from Sam Julien. Not just for developers! My current favourite newsletter! Fully of practical tips. â™¥
* [The 3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1) from James Clear.
* [UX Writing Events](https://www.uxwritingevents.com/ ) from Scott Kubie. Not just about events.
* [Bizarro Devs](https://bizzarodevs.com/issues/)
* [Developer Avocados](https://tinyletter.com/developeravocados)
* [The Observatory](https://orbit.love/blog). Community newsletter from Orbit.
* [Increment](https://store.increment.com/products/increment-subscription). A quarterly, full-color magazine that is excellent.
* [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). "A front-end web development newsletter that sparks joy". It's excellent!
* [The Communities Show](https://www.communities.show/). I rarely have time to watch an entire episode, but I love reading the newsletters! Most of the in-jokes go over my head.
* [Velocity](https://velocitypartners.com/blog/). B2B content marketing. Tongue in cheek. Tries for irony. Somewhat loathsome yet I can't look away.
* [FeverBee](https://www.feverbee.com/richs-blog/). Richard posts too frequently - sometimes daily! No matter the quality of the content, I'm going to unsubscribe.


### Fun

* [Hand Spinning News](https://hand-spinning-news.com/ ) from Sheila Dixon.
* [The kid should see this](https://thekidshouldseethis.com/)
* [Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter/) from Kottke.org


## Retired from my list
I subscribed to these newsletters for a long time but have since moved on because I find that I no longer need  what they have to give. I still like to dip in when I have time or need to look up something in particular.

* [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)
* [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/)
* [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
