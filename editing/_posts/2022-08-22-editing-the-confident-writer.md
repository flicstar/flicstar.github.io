I edit a lot of different kinds of writers.  I‚Äôm not a one-size-fits-all editor (and really, is anyone? ü§î)
 
In my world, confident writers take the form of **technical writers**.
 
I like editing tech writers. I can go a bit deeper into the weeds - nerding out about language, words, and how they fit together. Knowing I‚Äôm with a like-minded soul is a comfortable place to be. But not a time to get complacent! I enjoy the challenge of having to work harder to add value. Whilst I do suggest changes, I usually don't take a hard line. I'm quick to bow down to their authorly preferences. 

An editor helps the confident writer by bringing a new perspective - being able to [see the forest for the trees](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/what-does-cant-see-the-forest-for-the-trees-mean). 
 
In the podcast, the confident writer is precious about their writing. ‚Äú*The idea of someone changing a comma makes them shudder*‚Äù. These are difficult writers to edit. They never quite make it to 'understanding' on the [feedback staircase](https://align4profit.com/stand-feedback-staircase-2/). I've had my share of editing these kinds of writers  - they push back every change, defending and explaining every choice. These folk aren‚Äôt interested in your editing skills. It is a thankless task to review their writing.

Most tech writers embrace the idea of someone reviewing their writing. They see the value of an editor because they themselves have experience **editing others**. And that's what makes them a pleasure to edit.
