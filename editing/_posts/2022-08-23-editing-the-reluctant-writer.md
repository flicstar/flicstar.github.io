The **reluctant writer**: ‚Äú*Writing is not your thing. You wrestle words onto the page and everything looks and feels wrong*.‚Äù

I edit a lot of different kinds of writers. Some who are writers-first, others who wouldn‚Äôt call themselves writers: UX designers, software developers, product managers. These are my reluctant writers.
 
When editing non-writers, [tread gently](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/editing-in-open-source) - especially in open source where contributions are voluntary. The last thing you want to do is discourage a reluctant writer with pedantry and a mass of corrections.
 
* An editor can help a reluctant writer by ensuring the writing is **fit for purpose**.    
ü§ì Look at the bigger picture and understand the context.
 
* Acting as a reader advocate, the editor can help with **logic and flow**.   
   ü§ì Rearrange sentences and paragraphs to tighten the narrative.
  
* Be a friendly editor and look for opportunities to create **teachable moments**.   
   ü§ì  Give thoughtful, constructive feedback. 

The [positivity pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) is great for reluctant writers. As is a [collaborative writing](https://flicstar.com/collaboration-in-tech-writing) approach.
