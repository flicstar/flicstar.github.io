Blogstars is a series where I review articles written by tech bloggers and call out things they've done well, to help other bloggers improve their writing. 


> G'day! flicstar your friendly editor here. I help writers create great written content. Let me help you improve your writing by taking a look at what some others are doing really well.


I like making writers feel good ðŸ¤— In this series, I do a [Positivity Pass](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/) and use [editing codes](https://github.com/open-strategy-partners/editing-codes) to review articles and call out specific techniques for effective writing.
