I am Felicity Brand (aka flicstar). I am a technical communicator â€” currently working remote, asynchronous and distributed (RAD!).

I am currently working as a communcations consultant alongside my amazing, learned and inspirational colleagues at [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/){:target="_blank"}; practicing empathy and working truthfully using our authentic communication model.

I am a member of the [TYPO3 Association](https://typo3.org/), an open source CMS project. I contribute to that project in the Documentation Team and Content Team. I co-authored [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246){:target="_blank"} published January 2021.

I am involved with [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/){:target="_blank"}, creating best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software.
