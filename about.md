<p align="center">I am Felicity Brand (aka flicstar). </p>

I am a technical communicatorâ€”currently working remote, asynchronous and distributed (RAD! ðŸ˜Ž). I'm based in Melbourne, Australia.

<img src="/assets/images/pages/osplogo.jpg" alt="OSP logo" align="right" width="80px"/>

I work as a technical editor and writer at [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/){:target="_blank"}, a strategic communications agency. I love being a part of this team, where I can [write](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog) and [speak](https://open.spotify.com/show/3JRgwdSRC8knAdkMrU6jOb) about writing and editing.  

<img src="/assets/images/pages/typo3logo.png" alt="TYPO3 logo" align="right" width="75px"/>

I am a member of the [TYPO3 Association](https://typo3.org/){:target="_blank"}, an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the [Documentation Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation) and [Content Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/content). This is a great community. If you're looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it! I co-authored [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246){:target="_blank"}, published January 2021.

I am involved with [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/){:target="_blank"}, creating best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software. It's heaps cool over there - you should totally come and join us.
