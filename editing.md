I work as an editor at [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/). I also edit as part of the writers collective, [Foster](https://www.foster.co/).

### Writing about editing

* [Respectful review comments in open source]()
* [Editing the impatient writer]()
* [Avoid writer's block when you're editing content]()
* [From code reviews to prose reviews]()
* [Editing skills: innate or learned?]()
* [Anatomy of an editing comment]()

## Editing codes

[Editing codes](https://openstrategypartners.com/resources/the-osp-editing-codes/) are semantic short codes that are a lightweight convention for reviewing content. They communicate the rationale behind a suggested edit based on a specific writing guideline.

The codes were devised by Open Strategy Partners (disclaimer: I work there!).

## Blogstars Series

I review articles written by tech bloggers and call out things they've done well. Why? To make them feel good ðŸ¤— and to call out specific techniques to help other bloggers improve their writing.

* [Blogstar: Tahi](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/blogstar-tahi). Tahi shows us how to write authentically. Authentic voice is something to be prized - especially amidst the rise of AI content generators.
* [Blogstar: Ronald](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/blogstar-ronald). Ronald shows us how to write effective headings. Chunking your content and choosing consistent wording means your reader can confidently navigate your writing.
