## Writing about editing

I work as a technical editor. To keep my editing skills sharp, I write.



## Editing codes

[Editing codes](https://openstrategypartners.com/resources/the-osp-editing-codes/) are semantic short codes that represent the writing principles in your writer's guide.

The codes are a lightweight convention for reviewing content. They communicate the rationale behind a suggested edit based on a specific writing guideline.

The codes were devised by Open Strategy Partners (disclaimer: I work there!).
