Recommended ðŸŽ§: [Eric Holscher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-holscher/) on The Business of Open Source podcast. An articulate and engaging speaker, I enjoyed hearing such an honest take on the open source sustainability puzzle from someone who's lived it.

The maker-taker tension he describes is familiar to many #opensource maintainers: the joy of providing value, mixed with the challenge of sustaining projects when users (often large companies) benefit without contributing back. A masterclass in letting value guide your path, Eric describes trying consulting, support, and donation drives, before [Read the Docs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/read-the-docs/) found sustainability in advertising \- a model they'd initially resisted because developers are stubborn ðŸ™ƒ "We literally tried every other revenue source before we tried the very obvious and appropriate one of selling ads."

Bonus: Hearing the accidental origin story of the [Write the Docs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/write-the-docs/) community. How it very quickly morphed from a gathering of Read the Docs users into a global community of people who care about #documentation. Especially poignant given ASTC's recent closure \- a reminder that tech writers will always seek ways to connect and support each other. ðŸ’œ
