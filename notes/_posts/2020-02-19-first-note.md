I presented this talk at the [Write the Docs Meetup Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Write-the-Docs-Australia/events/268284615/) in February 2020.

It is a retrospective on the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) 2019 program, and covers some of the hurdles I experienced coming in to open source from the corporate world.
