ICYMI from late 2024: [Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabrizioferri/) on the [Stack Overflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stack-overflow/) podcast talking about documentation engineering. 

What a masterclass in articulating our craft! From docs-as-code and the future of AI in documentation, to breaking down the false divide between internal/external docsâ€”every response was thoughtful and nuanced. 

Highly recommend! ðŸŽ§ [Your docs are your infrastructure](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/11/26/your-docs-are-your-infrastructure/)
