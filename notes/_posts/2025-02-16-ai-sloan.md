I really enjoyed reading Robin Sloan's [Is it okay](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/is-it-okay/), then Baldur Bjarnason's response [Subtly wrong is more dangerous](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/2025/subtly-wrong-is-more-dangerous/), then Robin's [comment](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/science-fiction/) on his response, then Bjarnason's [response to Sloan's response](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/2025/now-im-disappointed/). 

Not only are they good writers, it's an interesting topic and I found it refreshing to see respectful disagreement.
