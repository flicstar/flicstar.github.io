Have you heard about Mustafa Suleyman's book, [The Coming Wave](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90590134-the-coming-wave)? He's the co-founder of DeepMind. 

I've listened to a couple of podcasts with him talking about the book and it's thought-provoking. There is an [Armchair Experts episode](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/mustafa-suleyman) with him, but I think a better one is [Intelligence Squared \- the AI revolution (Part 1\)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RjzGXbalo6pFoCg9fZkAx?si=85e4b5d20e3f43c3). 

He's articulate and easy to listen to. I don't necessarily agree with all his conclusions... but I can see a lot of what he's talking about coming to pass.
