A great article from Joe Shindelar which perfectly encapsulates the pain of every tech writer ever! We see you 🤗 

[Drupal CMS Docs: Should We Combine the CMS and User Guides?](https://drupalize.me/blog/drupal-cms-docs-should-we-combine-cms-and-user-guides)

And it's a prime example of how #docs can be a powerful instrument for exposing and surfacing broader issues that need to be addressed in the product they're trying to document.

> This is similar to the broader question of how Drupal CMS and Drupal core relate to one another that a lot of people in the
> community and the starshot leadership team are trying to work through right now.

May the force be with you, Joe, in this challenging conundrum. 🔧
