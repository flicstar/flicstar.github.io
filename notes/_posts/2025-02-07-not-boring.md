Thrilled to hear [The Good Docs Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-good-docs-project/) mentioned in the latest episode of [The Not Boring Tech Writer podcast](https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/episodes/2e3a5bfc-a359-473c-886d-0cc2e1fc4c99). 

It's cool to see my ðŸ’œ fave open source documentation initiative continue to make waves in the tech writing community.
