Love this story about two of my favorite things: #opensource and #documentation.

[JoliCode](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jolicode/) and [Premier Octet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/premieroctet/), both [Symfony](https://www.linkedin.com/company/symfony-sas/) companies, donated their time and expertise to improve the [TYPO3](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typo3-gmbh/) documentation search. They even covered half the project's cost themselves, showing true commitment to open-source principles.

This is what makes the broader tech community amazing â€“ people coming together to make things better, one pull request at a time.
