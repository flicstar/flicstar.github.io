Exciting milestone at [Open Strategy Partners GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-strategy-partners-gmbh/)! ðŸš€ We've #opensourced a Model Context Protocol (MCP) based on our marketing toolkit for creating technical content, from our value map for product positioning to our writing guide and editing codes.

Major kudos to [Robert Douglass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberttdouglass/) for leading this innovative project.

Curious? Start with the blog post explaining MCP's impact: [The Model Context Protocol: Why marketing leaders should care about AI's new universal language](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-model-context-protocol-unify-your-marketing-stack-with-ai/)
