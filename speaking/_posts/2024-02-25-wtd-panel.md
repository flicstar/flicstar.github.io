I hosted a panel at [Write the Docs Australia 2023](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/) conference and it was awesome. Three experts having a yarn about the trials and tribulations of technical communication and working in tech.

This was a first for me - hosting a panel. I can see how to improve and now I want another go!

The panelists were pros, though, and made me look good. We gathered questions from delegates in the days leading up to the conference. I organized them into general themes to give the chat some structure. Then we opened it to the audience for general 'ask me anything' style queries.

It was a wonderful, eye-opening experience and we got some great feedback about the session. I wrote a fuller summary of the chat over on the Open Strategy Partners blog.
