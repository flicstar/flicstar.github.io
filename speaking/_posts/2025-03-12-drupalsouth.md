I presented [AX: Turning your B2B tech strategy into content that converts](https://drupalsouth.org/events/drupalsouth-melbourne-2025/schedule/3493)
 at my first Drupal event, [DrupalSouth Melbourne 2025](https://drupalsouth.org/events/drupalsouth-melbourne-2025).

My presentation focussed on OSP's three principles of [Authentic Communication — empathy, clarity, and trust](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/empathy-clarity-and-trust-the-cornerstones-of-a-successful-communication-and-content-strategy/).

I found some uncanny parallels between my  talk and Nicola Nye’s keynote, [Humanizing Technology](https://drupalsouth.org/events/drupalsouth-melbourne-2025/schedule/3643). We’re threading the same needle: bringing humanity back to the center of our digital solutions.

I'm grateful to Open Strategy Partners for supporting me to attend events like this. I love having the opportunity to learn, share, and connect with open source communities that value both the technical and human aspects of digital experiences.
