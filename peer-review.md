## Confidential, obligation-free review

Are you a tech writer by day who blogs in your spare time? Let me be your editor ðŸ¤“

For free!!

### Writing is hard

Does this sound familiar?
* Youâ€™re a confident writer but sometimes self-editing is hard. 
* You're a developer and writing isn't your day job. 
* You're a non-native English speaker and you're writing in English.
* You've hit publish and want a [beta reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_reader). 

### Editing is important

When Hemingway App and Grammarly just don't cut it, you need a human! More than that, a fellow documentarian. Someone who understands what you're writing about. 

I've been a technical communicator for 14 years which has given me a broad understanding of technology. This means that if you're writing about writing or tech, you won't have to explain the context to me. It also means that whether you're writing for writers or developers, I can advocate for your reader. 

Iâ€™m a friendly, confident editor.

Pass your published (or ready-to-publish) piece over to me and Iâ€™ll peer review it for free. I'll give you feedback, comments and suggestions that you can take or leave. 

### What do I get out of it?

I love editingâ€”this helps me extend my experience and constantly improve. Also I just love helping. 

### Safe and sound

I won't tell anyone I edited your work. I won't talk about it on socials. I won't credit myself on your work to others. 

### Share the love 

If you want to give back, feel free to give me a shout-out with an "Edited by flicstar" acknowledgement on your published piece. Or a friendly tweet, whatever. 
But really, there's no obligation.
