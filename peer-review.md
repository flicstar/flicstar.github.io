Have you just hit publish and want a sanity check on your writing? 

If you're a tech writer who blogs, I'll peer review your work for free. 🤓

Sometimes Hemingway App and Grammarly just don't cut it—you need a human! More than that, a fellow documentarian.

### Send it over 🚚

Pass your published (or ready-to-publish) piece over to me (Github, Google Doc, email attachment, whatever) and I’ll peer review it. I'm a friendly, empathetic editor.

Catch me at felicitybrand at gmail dot com, or DM me on [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flicstar_).

### Confidential 🔐

I won't tell anyone I edited your work. I won't talk about it on socials. I won't credit myself on your work to others. 

### Obligation-free 🤷‍♀️

You can take-or-leave my feedback. No worries.
