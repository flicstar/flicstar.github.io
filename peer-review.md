Have you just hit publish and want a coherence check on your writing? 

If you're a tech writer who blogs, I'll peer review your work. 🤓

Sometimes Hemingway App and Grammarly just don't cut it—you need a human! More than that, a fellow documentarian.

### Send it over 🚚

Pass your published (or ready-to-publish) piece over to me and I’ll have a read. I’m a friendly, empathetic editor, and will give you some gentle feedback.

Catch me at felicitybrand at gmail dot com, or DM me on [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flicstar_).

### Confidential 🔐

I won’t tell anyone I read your work (unless you want me to). I won’t credit myself on your work to others.

### Obligation-free 🤷‍♀️

You can take-or-leave my feedback. No worries.
