## Confidential, obligation-free review

Are you a tech writer by day who blogs in your spare time? Let me be your editor 🤓

### Sound familiar?

* You’re a confident writer but sometimes self-editing is hard. 
* You're a developer and writing isn't your day job. 
* You're a non-native English speaker and you're writing in English.
* You've hit publish and want a [beta reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_reader). 

When Hemingway App and Grammarly just don't cut it, you need a human! More than that, a fellow documentarian. 

### Yoo-hoo, over here 🙋‍♀️

I’ll be your friendly tech editor. I have 14 years' experience as a technical communicator and a broad understanding of technology. 
Because I'm already in the space, if you're writing about writing or tech, you won't have to explain the context to me.

Pass it over and I’ll peer review for free. I'll give you feedback, comments and suggestions that you can take or leave. 

### What do I get out of it?

I love editing—this helps me extend my experience and constantly improve. Also I just love helping. 

### Safe and sound

I won't tell anyone I edited your work. I won't talk about it on socials. I won't credit myself on your work to others. 

If you want to give back, feel free to give me a shout-out with an "Edited by flicstar" acknowledgement on your published piece. Or a friendly Tweet, whatever. 
But really, there's no obligation.
