## Confidential, obligation-free review

Are you a tech writer by day who blogs in your spare time? Let me be your editor ü§ì

For free!!

### Writing is hard

Does this sound familiar?
* You‚Äôre a confident writer but sometimes self-editing is hard. 
* You're a developer and writing isn't your day job. 
* You're a non-native English speaker and you're writing in English.
* You've hit publish and want a [beta reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_reader). 

### Editing is important

When Hemingway App and Grammarly just don't cut it, you need a human! More than that, a fellow documentarian. Someone who understands what you're writing about. 

With 14 years' experience as a technical writer, I have a broad understanding of technology. This means that if you're writing about writing or tech, you 
won't have to explain the context to me. It also means I can advocate for your readers, be they writers or developers.

I‚Äôm a friendly, confident editor.

Pass your published (or ready-to-publish) piece over to me‚ÄîGithub, Google Doc, email attachment, whatever. I‚Äôll peer review it for free. I'll give you feedback, comments and suggestions that you can take or leave. 

üìù Catch me at felicitybrand at gmail dot com, or DM me on [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flicstar_).

### What do I get out of it?

I love editing‚Äîthis helps me extend my experience and constantly improve. Also I just love helping. 

### Safe and sound

I won't tell anyone I edited your work. I won't talk about it on socials. I won't credit myself on your work to others. 

### Share the love 

If you want to give back, feel free to acknowledge me on your published piece ("Edited by flicstar"). Or send a friendly tweet, whatever. But really, there's no obligation.
