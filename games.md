**Tiny Bang Story**  A point-and-click game that involves solving puzzles. You click around until you’re given a kind of ‘shopping list’ of things to gather to unlock a puzzle. You collect the things, unlock the puzzle, do the puzzle, then you get another list of things to find.  This was an ideal game for us to play because it has chapters that follow a predictable pattern. Within each chapter, you can collect flies to earn hints. Edie quickly grasped the structure of the game and when we got stuck, she was happy to click flies to earn hints. 

At the end of each chapter, there is a jigsaw puzzle to complete. Fun! The best thing about this game was that two of us could tap the screen at once. We could solve the jigsaw together at the same time. 

I totally recommend this game! After we played it once we went through and played it all over again a second time. I think once enough time has passed, we will definitely play it again. Super fun!
