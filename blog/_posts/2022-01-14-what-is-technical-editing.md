I write about technical editing. Hereâ€™s what I mean when I use the term "technical editing".

> Editing online written content about software, hardware, and related technical concepts.

I donâ€™t write about:

- Traditional print publishing
- Book editing
- Video and image editing
- Editing in other technical fields like medical, academic, and scientific editing

## The act of editing

In my experience the term "edit" encompasses a variety of actions. 

A technical editor will read the content and then might:

- Make direct changes to the text
- Suggest corrections and revisions
- Add commentary 
- Check links and verify sources
- Ask questions and seek clarification
- Give praise and celebrate the author

## Types of content

When I use the phrase "online written content", I mean any short-form or long-form writing for the web. For example:

| **Shorter** | **Longer** |
|--- | ---|
| Social messages | Software documentation |
| Product statements | Community Contributor guides |
| Web page content | White papers |
| Release notes | FAQs |
| READMEs | Blog posts |
| Newsletter introductions | Tutorials  |
| Infographics  |  |

Working with a variety of content types requires working with a variety of tools.

## The know-how

The word "technical" here refers to having an understanding of technology. 

[Software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), and [every business is a software business](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=30368). This means a large portion of content created today is written either *by *developers or *for* developers. 

A technical editor has domain knowledge. They understand the concepts and vocabulary of the subject matter, while also having the skills to make those concepts clear and understandable to a non-technical reader.
