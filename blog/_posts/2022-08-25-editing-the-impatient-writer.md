**Impatient writers**: “*You just want to get the darn thing out there and hope no one notices or cares about mistakes*.” 

My impatient writers are developers and subject matter experts. 

Impatient writers are usually working to a deadline - to make a release announcement, write an upgrade guide or announce a security vulnerability. Their message is important and detailed. 

This kind of writer benefits from fresh eyes. I help by polishing the text, ensuring the writing is clear and adheres to the style guide. 

When you publish sloppy writing, it can damage your credibility as an author. On a broader level, it can impact the brand reputation of your business or open source project. 

It’s a lost opportunity if you don’t get an editor to look at your work. It’s best if I can see it before it's published, but I have been known to edit live content. 🙈
