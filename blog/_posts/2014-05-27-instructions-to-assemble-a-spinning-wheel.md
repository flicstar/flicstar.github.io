I have only ever documented software.

One of my secret tech writer dreams is to write doco for tangible products.

Recently I bought a portable spinning wheel that folds up and fits into a carry bag. It is called a Joy and it is aptly named - a marvel of design and engineering.

When the box arrived, I had to assemble the wheel. A very exciting prospect because I like building things and I like reading instructions.

I was keen to play every tech writer's favourite game of picking the guide to pieces.

Imagine my disappointment when it was actually quite okay! 

## The critique ##

It was two column layout. Some of the content ran down the page, some of it across. A trifle confusing but not too bad.

The guide started with a graphic parts list (Ikea style), but should have also included a labelled diagram of the assembled wheel.

Spinning wheel parts have names that may be foreign to new users. Reading instructions like "_Thread the flyer spindle into the top shaft..._" and "_Hold the whorl with one hand..._" would be double-dutch to a new spinner.

Happy and sad faces were used to show the correct tension.

## The re-write ##

One of the opportunities open to job-hunting tech writers is to take a poor example of writing, improve it and then send it back to the source.

I think I’ll take the high road on this one. I really like the Ashford company and their products. Although I could completely redesign their user guide, one could argue that there’s nothing really wrong with it since I managed to assemble the wheel with no problems.

Any anyway, I'd rather be spinning. Look how it folds up  - so cool!
