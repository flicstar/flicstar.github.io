## Open source
### TYPO3

* Contributed in the [Content Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/content) as an editor and writer. We had a bumper year, publishing over 100 community-contributed articles.
* Officially stepped away from the Documentation Team. 
* Continued my [community membership](https://typo3.org/project/association/membership) in the TYPO3 Association.
* Was invited to be a member of the [TYPO3 awards jury panel](https://flicstar.com/t3con) for T3CON23. It was a great experience!

### The Good Docs Project
* Co-led the Content Strategy Working Group, and was involved in a few other working groups across the project (style guide, template audit, and blog).
* Consciously stepped away from contributing to this project in June. It was a great decision for me.
* I'm on the steering committee and continue to do socials on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/89824113/).

## Open Strategy Partners
I spent another year working with [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/). 
I get to work with awesome clients, learn from smart colleagues, do interesting stuff, and meet fun people. This year we got into SEO-based briefs and wrote lots of longer form articles. I interviewed people for our podcast, [Communicate, Connect, Grow](https://openstrategypartners.com/resources/the-osp-podcast/). We continued our practice of gratitude and I’m grateful that OSP offers psychological safety so that we can make mistakes and learn from them.

## Writing & editing
### Foster
* I started contributing as an editor in this [writers' collective](https://tally.so/r/wd0xBd). The minimum requirement is to edit three pieces a month and I average about five. It’s been thoroughly enjoyable and I get to edit a wide variety of content across multiple genres.
* I earned 100 'Thanks' tokens in the first month (yay!) and  I’m working steadily towards getting my first paycheck. 
* Participated in [Season 3 The Artisan’s Way](https://flicstar.com/taw-foster) and had my mind blown.

### My website flicstar.com

* Worked out how to use my blog categories. Moved my About page to the front. 
* Shared blog posts on social media (again) and was more active and involved on LinkedIn. 
* Continued to build and engage with my network.
