My daughter made me watch a 4.5 hour Minecraft ‚Äúmovie‚Äù on YouTube. It wasn‚Äôt really a movie, it was several videos stitched together by a very talented gamer, Katherine Elizabeth. 
We came away from that experience with the question, ‚ÄúIf we download Minecraft, can we play this game called "[StarQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtyvvPRhUhw)"? The short answer is [no](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/t87tk1/katherine_elizabeth_gaming/), but we‚Äôre now both hooked anyway.

I just got back from the [Everything Open](https://2024.everythingopen.au/) conference where I caught the presentation [Crafting Worlds Together: The open source behind Minecraft's multiplayer universe](https://2024.everythingopen.au/schedule/presentation/43/), 
and I am convinced by the legitimacy of Minecraft as a fun and educational STEM tool for my six year old (and myself!).

## Getting Started
Which version to play? It was a no-brainer for us to go with Pocket Edition (Bedrock) because we play on iPads. The biggest learning curve was the controls - after [playing Machinarium and Samorost](https://flicstar.com/games), 
working out how to move was full of frustration. Which was actually a good thing for her to see me fail since she tends to assume I have all the answers. This was a good opportunity for role 
reversal - she picked it up faster than I did and was often consoling me and encouraging me not to give up. More than once we stomped away in frustration, only to come back and gently encourage each other that "_It just takes practice!_"

## The Joys of Minecraft
So it turns out Minecraft is really fun. Who knew!? üòÇ Only about half the population for oh, thirteen years? We‚Äôre late to the party. We play in **creative** mode on the `peaceful` setting. We started out in different worlds. Eventually I went into my Microsoft account, set her up as a family member, configured all the settings so that we can be 
friends on the same LAN and now, finally, we can play in the same world.  

Being six, she is an enthusiastic, fearless builder and doesn‚Äôt skimp on detail. It wasn‚Äôt long before she had dug from the 
river to her home and built an axolotl play area. She also constructed a pen for horses (shaped like an actual horse‚Äôs head), a massive glass mushroom, and an underwater pool with double story diving board. Meanwhile I‚Äôm faffing around 
cutting down trees and smashing things at every turn. (It took me a LONG time to learn the controls.)

As our first joint project, we built a bridge across the river. Now I‚Äôm starting to build a house on the bank across from her. There is a lot of laughter, trial and error, achievements, and fun. We wave at each other using the character emotes. There is an inexplicable joy
in interacting with an avatar version of your friends in a virtual world. I guess that explains the popularity of multi-player games. ü§£

## Salutary lesson: The Getting Lost Adventure
During a rare solo-playing session, my daughter decided to go exploring so she flew up really high - like, really really high - then went in a few different directions. Next thing I know, she ran to me and in a small voice 
she spoke into my knees, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find my way home‚Äù. Turns out Minecraft is a big, wide world like any other ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt take note of 
your surroundings, you can get lost. She had that real-world feeling of dislocation and panic. 
I didn't know how to help her, but got stuck into research and quickly found that it wasn't going to be an easy task to find the way back home. 

At first I was thinking, this will be a good test of disappointment and fortitude. I started counseling her, "I'll try but you might have to rebuild from scratch."  She was 
being pretty stoic about it. Meanwhile I'm devouring forum threads, going down Reddit rabbit holes and scrubbing through YouTube tutorials: 
"_What to do when you get lost in Minecraft_". 

üó∫ They all start with "First thing to do before you get lost, is write down your coordinates". Ha! üôÉ

## Tips for finding home

The basic idea is to die so you can respawn back to a recognizable point. Because we're in creative mode, you can't die. One tip was to dig straight down to kill yourself so that you‚Äôre forced to respawn. So I 
spent 5 minutes digging down. I went through the Nether and into the void.... but didn't die. Nuts! Now I really am stuck. I‚Äôm both lost _and_ I can't get out of the void. Hahaha. Okay. So.

Then I got onto a hot tip which was to save and close, then set the world to **survival** mode - when you launch the world, because you're in the void, you instantly die and respawn back to your last bed. It worked! Huzzah.
Then save and close again, switch back to creative mode and we're set. Still lost, but at least no longer in the void, and now near a bed so we can sleep the night away.

So what do we do now - randomly fly around A WHOLE WORLD to find her build? That feels like hard work. More googling led me to the website [Chunkbase](https://www.chunkbase.com/) that shows you the map of the world for your seed‚Äîincluding the original
spawn point. Cool! At least we can now work systematically.

Next step: hand over to a more patient adult to do a grid search of surroundings. Quickly teach them the controls. Husband spends almost 20 minutes looking and at dusk on the first day, he spies the familiar glint of a giant glass mushroom, the 
horse enclosure, axolotls. Happy Days Mate!


## Surfing the learning curve

That chaotic getting-lost-and-found experience was actually supremely rewarding (for me, anyway). Getting lost taught me some useful things: 

* The importance of knowing where you are.
* How to configure displaying your coordinates.
* How to use the command console to enter coordinates and teleport.
* How to fly - it‚Äôs double-tap on the up button. (You can jump and jump and jump but jumpin‚Äô ain‚Äôt flyin‚Äô. It‚Äôs a double-tap!!!)

PS: I also learnt, after punching a poor cow many a time, that to put on a name tag you do a long press. A friggin‚Äô long press on poor Daisy. 

### Links & resources

Many of the Minecraft tutorials suffer from the curse of knowledge. It‚Äôs such an old game, with many device options, so a lot of the more granular instructions get glossed over or assumed completely. No fix for this, just sayin'. 

Here's a few link I'm keeping for future reference:

- [Chunkbase seed map](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map)
- [Dig Minecraft](https://www.digminecraft.com) for good tutorials

## The joys of bonding over creative gaming

I‚Äôve said it before, but [digital gameplay is still gameplay](https://flicstar.com/gaming), and it is a legitimate outlet for creativity. I can also tell that a big component of this current obsession is that we play together as a joint activity. I genuinely love it but I _do_ have to set a strict 1 hour timer because it sucks you in.
