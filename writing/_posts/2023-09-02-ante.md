An **unclear antecedent** is what happens when you can't tell which noun a pronoun is supposed to stand in for. 

Unclear antecedents can be common in writing about tech because the content can get noun-phrase heavy. The industry likes to verbalize nouns, and noun-ize verbs. 
Sometimes it can be hard to understand what is doing the doing, or what is being acted upon. 

Another favorite hangout for unclear antecedents is in case studies. When writing a piece that describes your clientâ€™s client, and then also referring to their customers or end-users, the rhetorical distance 
between "this, "that" and "they" can get quite long.

When writing, be consistent with address, remember whoâ€™s talking, and spell out what is being referred to. For longer, multi phrase sentences, check that each 
part makes sense.

At OSP, our editing codes give us a shared language to talk about the craft of writing. We use the code ANTE to call out unclear antecedents.
