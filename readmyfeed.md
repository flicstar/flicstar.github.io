> I'm using this list to build out an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) of technical writing resources on GitHub. Feel free to [add to the list](https://github.com/flicstar/read-my-feed)!

   There’s more tech content than anyone can possibly keep up with. How do you balance the overload while drinking from the firehose? What makes something truly share-worthy? And does the stream in your feed actually shape your practice? Join me as we look for ways to break out of echo chambers and uncover fresh voices worth following.
